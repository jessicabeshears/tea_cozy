Tea Cozy
========

This project was done off-platform through codecademy - 
the idea was to create a website landing page with a redline design copy.

I have tweaked a couple of things recently, but it was mostly making 
the links appear responsive (they don't actually link to anything) and 
giving some of the elements a little 'breathing room.'
